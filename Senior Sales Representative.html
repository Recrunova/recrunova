					Note: We support 100% remote work for applicants. This is a part-time role for 2 weeks and converted to full-time after that based on performance. During these 2 weeks, and since Recrunova is still pre-revenue, the compensation is $5 per hour + 5% commission for every $2K deal. After that, the salary will be negotiated upon conversion to full-time.
